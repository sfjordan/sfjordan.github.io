<div class="site-title">Hello, there!</div>
<p>My name is Sam Jordan, and I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at Princeton University. I've always been a more hands-on, tinkering kind of guy; as I grew up this interest shifted a bit from Legos to more computer-based projects. I built this site (partially as another project) but mainly to help share some of the things I've learned and built over the past few years.</p>
